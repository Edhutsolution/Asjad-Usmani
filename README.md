Conducting a feasibility study is the first step after the project concept is visualized. This process starts before creating a business case and signing the project charter.

The project business case document establishes the validity of the benefits of the project and builds the case for project authorization. Feasibility studies enhance your success rate by evaluating many parameters, identifying reasons to proceed or not with a project. 

The project charter authorizes the project’s existence.

In today’s blog post, we will discuss how to conduct a feasibility study for a project.

Feasibility is about validating an idea. It shows how realistic a venture can be. We call it a venture because a level of risk or uncertainty is involved.

Definition of a Feasibility Study

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a feasibility study is an investigation to show that the venture is doable.

From a business perspective, a feasibility study shows if a venture is worth the investment. The feasibility study is based on objective data.

In this study, you find the answer to the following questions:

Can it be done?

Is it realizable considering the various constraints?

Will it provide the desired result?

Is it aligned with the organizational goal?

How to Conduct a Feasibility Study

The feasibility study has many aspects, such as market feasibility (demand and supply forces), technical feasibility (do we have the technical know-how or do we outsource, train, retrain, etc.), and financial/economic feasibility (do we have the capital strength for this investment, or do we secure a loan? What are the financing options available?). 

We will adopt MTELOS Model for conducting a feasibility study that looks at the following six aspects:

Market Analysis  

Technical

Economic

Legal

Operational

Schedule

Market Analysis

Market analysis is applied to new products or improvements of existing ones.

Evaluate the market for your product’s demand against the supply dynamics. You can use a survey for this purpose. The survey must have objective questions. 

Here you find the answer to the following questions:

Who are my competitors?

What is driving the demand?

How is the supply chain for the intended product?

A quick SWOT analysis can help you find answers to the following questions:

What are my strengths? e.g., a good brand name, skilled personnel, a large workforce, proprietary technology, a large capital base, strategic location, etc.

What are my weaknesses? e.g., administrative bureaucracy, resource limitation, etc.

What are the opportunities of this venture? e.g., large market share, market penetration, few competitors, packaging, promotions, etc.?

What are the threats? e.g., government regulations and policies, price fluctuations, a competitive market?

Other aspects of market analysis are pricing and distribution channels. For example:

How do you set the price for your products?

What pricing model would you adopt?

Is the model a flexible or rigid one? 

What are the effects of the exchange rate, inflation, demography, population rise, urban-rural migration on price forecast?

Is the price dependent on an international benchmark like crude oil?

What is the market history?

What is the market forecasting?

Answers to these questions must be analyzed before reaching a decision. The feasibility study must be objective, as the investment decision will be based on its outcome.

You will analyze the supply chain. Here you will try to find answers to the following questions:

When will the customer receive the product after production starts? Good products with poor distribution often result in a loss in revenue. 

What strategy would you adopt to get orders from customers as quickly as possible?

Launch plans are equally important. Here, you can find answers to the following questions:

What is your rollout plan? 

Do you intend to have a promotion? 

How will you penetrate the market? 

How do you want to beat your competitors?

A business analyst will be helpful in answering these questions.

 

1. Technical Feasibility Study

While conducting the technical feasibility study, you see if you are technically capable of completing the project or not. 

The following table will show us the parameters and questions for conducting the technical feasibility study.

These are huge capital investments and involve equipment purchases, plant and machinery purchases, land or building purchases.
What are the OPEX (Operating Expenditures)? – This comprises both direct and indirect costs.
What is the direct cost?
Direct costs include labor, materials, inventory, production expenses, equipment/plant maintenance.
What is the indirect cost?
Indirect costs include electricity, rent, utilities, taxes, overhead costs from management, training, remuneration, personnel benefits/allowances, travels/logistics expenses, medical insurance, etc.
Are there intangible costs such as regulatory costs, environmental impacts, etc.?
What are the tangible and intangible benefits?
Tangible benefits are revenue, stakeholder equity, market share, fixtures, tools, etc.
Intangible benefits include the brand name, goodwill, reputation, social responsibility, strategic alignment, personnel development, etc.
What is the financial performance of the product/job/venture?
What financing options are applicable for the project such as loan facility, venture capital, overdraft, retained profits, grants and funding, sale and leaseback, PPP (Public-private partnership also called PFI (Private Finance Initiative), debenture, share capital, business angels, off-take agreement, supply agreement?

Review commercial databases to estimate standard costs for skills, human resources, and materials. 
Use published seller price lists to estimate prices.
At this early stage, a rough order of magnitude -25% to +75% may be used in cost estimating.
Take into consideration the exchange rate, inflation rate and build them into your cost estimate.
Cost of financing e.g., interest on loan should also be captured.
Three-point estimating can be used (c=O+3ML+P)/3)WhereO = Optimistic costP = Pessimistic costML = Most likely costC = estimated cost
Aggregate all the costs to arrive at a budget.
Determine the payback period, net present value or profitability index, break-even point, and cost-benefit ratio.
Determine a suitable funding model by carrying out Alternatives analysis.

IfC/B <1The project is economically feasible.Where C =CostB = Benefit
If NPV>0 venture is acceptable
If PI>1 accept the venture,otherwise, reject.WherePI = Profitability index

 

3. Operational Feasibility Study

The operational feasibility study examines the suitability of a solution. A solution that is not operational or impracticable is not worth pursuing.

 

S/N

 

Operational feasibility heading

Desired level or prompt questions

Outcome / To-do

Recommendation

1

Maintainability -This shows how easily the product or process can be restored in case of failure.

How maintainable is the process? 
Maintenance cost can be a burdensome recurring expenditure in the long run.

Analyze the lifecycle maintenance demands of the initiative.

Integrate these parameters early enough – at the design stage for ease.

Is the project duration realistic?

You could introduce schedule compression tools such as fast-tracking and crashing.
Find the project duration schedule model. 

 

 

Conclusion

Conducting a feasibility study ensures the project is worth pursuing and pursuable. It is done after the conceptual stage of a project. Project sponsors conduct this study themselves or they can take help from a third-party consultancy, project managers have no role here. This study is the first step toward a project creation.
